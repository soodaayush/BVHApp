## Inspiration

I noticed that students at Bay View High often miss important information because announcements are only made over the intercom. To address this, I decided to create a mobile app that could help improve communication.

## Challenges

I faced challenges in reacquainting myself with the processes involved in developing React Native apps, especially since it had been two years since I last worked on CoinDeno.

## Lessons Learned

I gained valuable experience in designing a user-friendly interface and organizing school-related information effectively.

## The Mobile App

This app provides access to news articles, a calendar of events, a staff directory, social media links, merchandise, and more.
